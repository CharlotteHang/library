7. use of delete notifications






















































1. iterator: show all the books and readers (add toString to book and reader)
2. Observer: Today's news
update the notification of recent activities and seminars, or who lost sth (very short)
if a reader click uninterested, then delete this from the reader's notifications and does not show next time.
The librarians can update the notification to a new one or delete the old one

Also, add a field called notifications (a list of strings) to the reader
add a stack field called notifications to the librarians


Or for simple, if a new book arrives (the Librarian who add the book have the right to decide whether it is
a very famous book and needs to notify every reader)
send notification to everyone, if another new book arrives, it substitute
the last one


3. I think the situation that who lost sth or a new book arrives is better, as a new reader to this library
needs not to know these past notifications

A. we can add subscribe icon, if the reader subscribe to that, we added to the observer list.

addObserver(Observer o) :add Observer to the list of observers for this subject.

deleteObserver(Observer o) :delete Observers from the list of observers .

notifyObservers() : notify all the observers if object has changed.

hasChanged() :return true if object has changed.

setChanged() :This method marks object has changed

clearChanged() :this method will indicate that subject has no changes or all the observers has been notified.
